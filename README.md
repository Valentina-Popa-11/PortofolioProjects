1st Project was born out of the desire to visually compare the effects of Covid-19 in the two countries between which I am divided. Although the strictness of the restrictions imposed by the two countries varied considerably, Romania and the United Kingdom were among the first countries in Europe that accepted the virus as a new reality. Using the Covid-19 Dataset as found at the following link on the 14th of May 2022: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths dragged a better understanding of the impact of the pandemic. In meantime, the dataset may have been changed at the source

2nd Project uses the Wholesale fruit and vegetable prices found at the following link:  https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/wholesale-fruit-and-vegetable-prices-weekly-average.
