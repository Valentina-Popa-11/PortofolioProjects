1st Project - Data Exploration using SQL
ğŸ’¡ Introduction - this project was born out of the desire to visually compare the effects of Covid-19 in the two countries between which I am divided.

is of purely personal interest, it analyzes the books held in the personal library in both countries, offering an overview.
